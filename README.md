backbone-amd
============

Create a scalable front-end application using Backbone JS, Underscore JS, Require JS and Bootstrap.

Requirements
============
This code is really flexible and does not require an application Server or Web server, the main idea is just to describe the code organization and components.


Introduction
============

According to the Backbone Documentation "Backbone should continue to be a tool that gives you the freedom to design the full experience of your web application", this leaves so many options for the developers to define their own implentation to create a scalable application, leaving the architecture implementation be defined by the developer expertise. This flexibility allows to create great variety of implementations for different porpouses but also open the window to have defficient code implementations and not scalable application.
